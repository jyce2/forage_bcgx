Completed a BCG X job simulation on Forage<br>

Goal: Transform businesses using data science to help companies adapt to changes in customer retention. <br>

1.	Business understanding & problem framing: what is the context of this problem and why are they trying to solve it?
2.	Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning: what data are we working with, what does it look like and how can we make it better?
3.	Feature engineering: can we enrich this dataset using our own expertise or third party information?
4.	Modeling and evaluation: can we use this dataset to accurately make predictions? If so, are they reliable?
5.	Insights & Recommendations: how we can communicate the value of these predictions by explaining them in a way that matters to the business?


Business problem: An electric company is a client of BCGX with a current problem in their company, and asks BCGX for help. Customer churn rates are increasing, and the company wants to know what factors are contributing to this problem by leveraging data on customer usage, time, price, and churn. 

Hypothesis: Is churn driven by customers' sensitivity to price changes?  

Plan: Model customer churn probabilities using a binary classification algorithm (e.g. Random Forest). Examine the predictive model's complexity, explained features, and performance metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision, and recall) to determine factors predicting churn. 

Datasets: 
1.	Customer data - which should include characteristics of each client, for example, industry, historical electricity consumption, date joined as customer etc.
2.	Churn data - which should indicate if customer has churned
3.	Historical price data â€“ which should indicate the prices the client charges to each customer for both electricity and gas at specific time intervals
